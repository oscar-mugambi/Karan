              Travelling means more to us than just seeing places. Travel is
              truly memorable when it involves meaningful engagements and
              elements of experiential learning. A big part of our expeditions
              are away from the big cities, with limited influence of modern
              life, where you get to experience life in a traditional and
              authentic manner. We expose you to traditional cultural, social
              and economic activities that are still practiced by the local
              people. To fully immerse and be part of the community, we
              prioritize homestays in traditional homesteads as much as
              possible.

              Would you like to listen to century-old tales while enjoying a
              bonfire? How about joining in traditional music and dance? Ever
              thought of enjoying home-brewed traditional beer. Karan gives you
              the chance to experience all that comes with staying with a local
              family, gelling in the culture and sharing their lives. Africans
              have a reputation for warmth and hospitality. There is perhaps no
              better a way to experience this than to be part of their daily
              lives and activities for a few days. Come join us and write your
              African tale as you explore amazing places and have life-changing
              experiences.

              Beyond the cultural experience, we let you have a taste of the
              standard tourism circuits. Get to see the Big-5, enjoy a long
              safari or take a short drive through the national park within a
              city. Have a meal with the giraffes, feed and bath orphaned
              elephants, take a day hike up some rugged hills or challenge
              yourself by summiting a mountain. You can choose to sample the
              white sandy beaches or possibly a night out in the city before
              your trip back home. We tailor what best suits you and guarantee a
              memorable experience!

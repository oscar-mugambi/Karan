  <h2>What You Should know Before Travelling to Kenya</h2>
  <ul class="to-know">
    <li>First of all, if you are a White person, you will have a new nickname – Mzungu. Do not take offence, it is not a bad one. It just means white person, has no negative connotation. It is not racist… just what many Africans would call you</li>
    <li>Africans are super-friendly and warm, and this may be unfamiliar and uncomfortable. They just want to ensure that you feel at home at all cost</li>
    <li>Different communities have different ways of expressing greetings. The most common one is shaking of hands, although this has changed with the onset of Covid-19. </li>
    <li>The weather at any given time of the year is varied but mostly warm and sunny. We will ensure to prepare you depending on the season you plan to travel.</li>
    <li>There are compulsory vaccinations required for entry to Kenya, in which case a Certificate of Inoculation against Yellow Fever is required for travelers older than one year. Most doctors recommend vaccinating against Polio, Tetanus, Hepatitis and Yellow Fever. Anti-malarial prophylactics are strongly recommended, and should be taken two weeks prior to your arrival. Please consult your own doctor regarding any personal health requirements.</li>
    <li>Kenya, like most African countries, is a multilingual country. Swahili and English are spoken as the two official languages, in addition to the numerous native languages. We ensure smooth communication in all our excursions. 
    </li>
    <li>Have some cash with you that you can convert into the local currency. This will come in handy while away from the big cities while shopping for souvenirs. 
    </li>
    <li>Be open-minded, let live and have an African experience. Forget about where you are from, what you have been told about Africa and live in the moment. Write your story!</li>

            <h2>MZUNGU</h2>
            <p>
              First of all, if you are a White person, you will have a new
              nickname – Mzungu. Do not take offence, it is not a bad one. It
              just means white person, has no negative connotation. It is not
              racist… just what many Africans would call you &#128522

            <p>
              Africans are super-friendly and warm, and this may be unfamiliar

            <p>
              Different communities have different ways of expressing greetings.
              The most common one is shaking of hands, although this has changed
              with the onset of Covid-19.

            <h2>VACCINATIONS</h2>
            <p>
              There are compulsory vaccinations required for entry to Kenya, in
              which case a Certificate of Inoculation against Yellow Fever is
              required for travelers older than one year. Most doctors recommend
              vaccinating against Polio, Tetanus, Hepatitis and Yellow Fever.
              Anti-malarial prophylactics are strongly recommended, and should
              be taken two weeks prior to your arrival. Please consult your own
              doctor regarding any personal health requirements.

            <h2>LANGUAGE</h2>
            <p>
              Kenya, like most African countries, is a multilingual country.
              Swahili and English are spoken as the two official languages, in
              addition to the numerous native languages. We ensure smooth
              communication in all our excursions.

            <h2>LOOSE CASH</h2>
            <p>
              Have some cash with you that you can convert into the local
              currency. This will come in handy while away from the big cities
              while shopping for souvenirs.

            <h2>ENJOY</h2>
            <p>
              Be open-minded, let live and have an African experience. Forget
              about where you are from, what you have been told about Africa and
              live in the moment. Write your story!

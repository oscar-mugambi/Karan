    <section class="about-us">
      Karan is a Kenyan-based company with a reach across the African continent.
      The untold real stories of Africa and its people are immense and unending.
      As your travel partner, we seek to explore the beauty and authenticity of
      our vast cultures and give you the opportunity to immerse yourself in it.
      Ours is to explore, share and enlighten others on what has either been
      misconceived or is not yet told. We partner with other curious travelers
      who are keen on new experiences away from the standard tourism. People who
      are ready to go off the beaten track and experience life as a local. We
      envision a world that appreciates how different we all are while allowing
      a pure human connection with each other. Karan’s inspiration lies in the
      connection made out of cultural exchanges and sharing of each other’s
      lives in the process. We offer real local experiences to socially aware,
      culturally curious and adventure seeking travelers who are looking for
      something genuine, unique and memorable to indulge in. We strive to make
      traveling a meaningful and profound social experience. Our reach includes
      non-Africans who want to delve and soak in the African spirit, as well as
      Africans who want to retrace their roots and engage with their past. We
      welcome you to a life-changing type of travel.
